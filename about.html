                Why we celebrate Diwali?

            <div class="p"><p>
                This is perhaps the most popular and widespread belief. And while this is true, the return of Rama to Ayodhya is certainly not the only reason why we celebrate Diwali. According to Ramayana, Dashratha, the father of Rama and the king of Ayodhya owed his wife Kaikeyi a favor. At an opportune moment, Kaikeyi sought to cash in on the favour and asked that the king banish Rama the kingdom’s favorite crown prince from the kingdom for 14 years and place her son, Bharata on the throne. The heartbroken king kept his word and banished Rama from Ayodhya. For the next 14 years, Rama and his wife Sita along with his brother Lakshmana wandered the forests of India. Their wanderings were interrupted by Ravana the king of Lanka who abducted Sita. After an epic battle, Rama, Lakshmana and Sita returned to Ayodhya and its subjects welcomed them by lighting oil lamps outside their homes and showing their favorite prince the way back home.

            <h4 class="sub">Birth of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and her wedding to Vishnu</h4>
            <div class="reasons"><div class="p"><p>
                Diwali is primarily a celebration of wealth. And it is thus that Lakshmi find herself in the midst of the narrative. Legends suggest that this is the day when Lakshmi was born’ out of the Samudra Manthan (or the Great Churning of the Ocean). Samudra Manthan is a mythical event that finds mention in the Puranas. The event refers to the churning of the Ocean of Milk by the gods and demons. It involved Mount Mandara that served as churning rod and Vasuki, the king of serpents, who resides around Shiva’s neck served as the churning rope. Among the wondrous things that emerged from this churning was Lakshmi. It is believed that Lakshmi emerged from the ocean on this day and was immediately married off to Vishnu. The wedding was celebrated by the lighting of oil lamps.

            <h4 class="sub">The killing of Narakasura</h4>
            <div class = "reasons">
            <div class="p"><p>According to legend, Narakasura was the son of Bhudevi, the Earth goddess and Varaha, the third incarnation of Vishnu. However over time Narakasura turned evil and he began expanding his reign and capturing kingdom after kingdom. He then trained his guns towards the heavens and overthrew Indra the king of the gods. To make matters worse he stole the earrings of Aditi, the heavenly mother goddess, usurped some of her territory, and kidnapped 16,000 princesses. The gods sought the help of Vishnu since it was predicted that his incarnation would be responsible for killing Narakasura. Vishnu, so the legend says, was born as Krishna and eventually married Satybhama who was also believed to be an incarnation of Bhudevi, the mother of Narakasura. Satyabhama was outraged at the ill-treatment of the princesses at the hands of Narakasura and urged her husband to wage a war against him. On the night before the New Moon, Krishna killed Narakasura and freed the 16,000 princesses. This day is celebrated as Narak Chaturdashi since it is the event took place 14th day of the month. In Goa, large effigies of Narkasura are burnt to commemorate the event.</p>
